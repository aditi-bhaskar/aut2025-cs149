VECTOR_WIDTH | vector utilization
-------------+--------------------
      2      |      92.4%
      4      |      90.8%
      8      |      89.9%
     16      |      89.5% 
Vector utilization decreases as VECTOR_WIDTH changes. In our implementation, we loop through multiplies up to the maximum exponent 
in the current vector. When the vector width is larger, this results in more amount of multiplies even for smaller exponents in the chunk. 
For example, if one chunk of exponents is 100 2 2 2, then a vector chunk of 2 is better than a vector chunk of 4.
