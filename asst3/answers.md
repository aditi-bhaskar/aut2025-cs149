## Part 2

todo: make sure it actually works



## Part 3

#### Replicate the score table generated for your solution and specify which machine you ran your code on.


#### Describe how you decomposed the problem and how you assigned work to CUDA thread blocks and threads (and maybe even warps).


#### Describe where synchronization occurs in your solution.


#### What, if any, steps did you take to reduce communication requirements (e.g., synchronization or main memory bandwidth requirements)?

#### Briefly describe how you arrived at your final solution. What other approaches did you try along the way. What was wrong with them?
